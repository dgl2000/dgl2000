*Me in front of the Big Rice University Logo*

ðŸŒ± I'm currently a graduate student pursuing the master of computer science degree at Rice University. I graduated from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence.

:briefcase: Seeking for software engineering intern in 2023 summer, I would aprreciate if you could offer any support!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, such as applications, programming, etc. I'm happy to answer!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to contact me via gaole.dai@rice.edu :D

:sob: **P.S. I used to upload codes via my undergraduate student GitLab account which expired after graduation, so there is almost nothing in this account :(**
